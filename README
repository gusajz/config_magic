Very simple configuration module with stuff that I usually need.

1. Singleton access to configuration in memory.
2. Load defaults from a dictionary.
3. Load a whole directory of configuration files (and merging the result with the previusly loaded configuration or defaults).

TODO:
Add HOCON and YAML support.
